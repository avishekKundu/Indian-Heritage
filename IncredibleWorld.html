                    India is a country that boasts of a rich culture. The culture of India refers to a collection of
                    minor unique cultures. The culture of India comprises of clothing, festivals, languages, religions,
                    music, dance, architecture, food, and art in India. Most noteworthy, Indian culture has been
                    influenced by several foreign cultures throughout its history. Also, the history of India‚Äôs culture
                    is several millennia old.
                    Also, many foreign religions are present in India as well. These foreign religions include Abrahamic
                    religions. The Abrahamic religions in India certainly are Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Besides
                    Abrahamic religions, Zoroastrianism and Bah√°‚Äô√≠ Faith are the other foreign religions which exist in
                    India. Consequently, the presence of so many diverse religions has given rise to tolerance and
                    secularism in Indian culture.

            <h1>FESTIVAL</h1>
            <p>
                <b>Festivals</b> are the oldest rituals and traditions our countrymen follow to pay tribute to the
                almighty gods and goddesses. In fact, these celebrations are nothing but the symbols of peace and
                happiness.
                <b>India</b> is a diverse country with multiple religions and cultures conglomerated in a single
                form. This is why our Festivals draw a unique picture for the rest of the world to follow as a brilliant
                example of harmony.
                In India, we have three different types of Festivals. The national Festivals are those days when
                something remarkable happened that changed the course of history for our country. For instance, 26th
                January is celebrated as <b>Republic Day</b>. October 2 is <b>Gandhi Jayanti</b>, the birthday of
                Mahatma Gandhi, the father of the nation. These Festivals are called gazette holidays declared years
                back.
                These days, every public and private office celebrates and declares holidays for the employees.
                <b>Independence Day</b> is celebrated on August 15, 1947. On this day, we received independence from the
                colonial rule of the British Empire. We celebrate and pay tribute to the revolutionaries who led
                their lives to make us free from the shackles of British tyranny. Republic Day is celebrated
                gallantly in New Delhi, our capital. Our defence forces join hands to perform tricks and showcase
                their power to the public. These Festivals are celebrated across the country.
                The most prominent religious Festivals that we celebrate are <b>Dussehra, Diwali, Eid-Ul-Fitr,
                    Christmas, Guru Nanak Jayanti, Holi etc.</b> Dussehra and Diwali are considered to be the prime
                religious Festivals of India. The states celebrating these Festivals get decorated like a new bride.
                New colourful dresses and tasty things to eat are the prime attractions for kids. During this time
                of the year, <b>people of all ages and economic stature unite at a single place to worship the gods and
                    goddesses.
                    Every Indian religious festival has a story behind it. These stories carry a message for all the
                    common men. Most of the Festivals convey the message of peace and the victory of good over evil.
                    Every family prepares delectable preparations and invites guests, relatives and other family
                    members. Families reunite, people enjoy for a few days and then get back with their monotonous
                    lives</b>. They again wait for another year eagerly for the religious Festivals to arrive with the
                wish to see their loved ones again.
